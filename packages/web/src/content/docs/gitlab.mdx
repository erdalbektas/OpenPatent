description: Use openpatent in GitLab issues and merge requests.
---

openpatent integrates with your GitLab workflow through your GitLab CI/CD pipeline or with GitLab Duo.

In both cases, openpatent will run on your GitLab runners.

---

## GitLab CI

openpatent works in a regular GitLab pipeline. You can build it into a pipeline as a [CI component](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/components/)

Here we are using a community-created CI/CD component for openpatent — [nagyv/gitlab-openpatent](https://gitlab.com/nagyv/gitlab-openpatent).

---

### Features

- **Use custom configuration per job**: Configure openpatent with a custom configuration directory, for example `./config/#custom-directory` to enable or disable functionality per openpatent invocation.
- **Minimal setup**: The CI component sets up openpatent in the background, you only need to create the openpatent configuration and the initial prompt.
- **Flexible**: The CI component supports several inputs for customizing its behavior

---

### Setup

1. Store your openpatent authentication JSON as a File type CI environment variables under **Settings** > **CI/CD** > **Variables**. Make sure to mark them as "Masked and hidden".
2. Add the following to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

   ```yaml title=".gitlab-ci.yml"
   include:
     - component: $CI_SERVER_FQDN/nagyv/gitlab-openpatent/openpatent@2
       inputs:
         config_dir: ${CI_PROJECT_DIR}/openpatent-config
         auth_json: $openpatent_AUTH_JSON # The variable name for your openpatent authentication JSON
         command: optional-custom-command
         message: "Your prompt here"
   ```

For more inputs and use cases [check out the docs](https://gitlab.com/explore/catalog/nagyv/gitlab-openpatent) for this component.

## GitLab Duo

openpatent integrates with your GitLab workflow.
Mention `@openpatent` in a comment, and openpatent will execute tasks within your GitLab CI pipeline.

---

### Features

- **Triage issues**: Ask openpatent to look into an issue and explain it to you.
- **Fix and implement**: Ask openpatent to fix an issue or implement a feature.
  It will work create a new branch and raised a merge request with the changes.
- **Secure**: openpatent runs on your GitLab runners.

### Setup

openpatent runs in your GitLab CI/CD pipeline, here's what you'll need to set it up:

:::tip
Check out the [**GitLab docs**](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/duo_agent_platform/agent_assistant/) for up to date instructions.
:::

1.  Configure your GitLab environment
2.  Set up CI/CD
3.  Get an AI model provider API key
4.  Create a service account
5.  Configure CI/CD variables
6.  Create a flow config file, here's an example:

        <details>

    <summary>Flow configuration</summary>

    ```yaml
    image: node:22-slim
    commands:
      - echo "Installing openpatent"
      - npm install --global openpatent-ai
      - echo "Installing glab"
      - export GITLAB_TOKEN=$GITLAB_TOKEN_openpatent
      - apt-get update --quiet && apt-get install --yes curl wget gpg git && rm --recursive --force /var/lib/apt/lists/*
      - curl --silent --show-error --location "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upciti/wakemeops/main/assets/install_repository" | bash
      - apt-get install --yes glab
      - echo "Configuring glab"
      - echo $GITLAB_HOST
      - echo "Creating openpatent auth configuration"
      - mkdir --parents ~/.local/share/openpatent
      - |
        cat > ~/.local/share/openpatent/auth.json << EOF
        {
          "anthropic": {
            "type": "api",
            "key": "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
          }
        }
        EOF
      - echo "Configuring git"
      - git config --global user.email "openpatent@gitlab.com"
      - git config --global user.name "openpatent"
      - echo "Testing glab"
      - glab issue list
      - echo "Running openpatent"

        Please execute the requested task using the available GitLab tools.
        Be thorough in your analysis and provide clear explanations.

        <important>
        Please use the glab CLI to access data from GitLab. The glab CLI has already been authenticated. You can run the corresponding commands.

        If you are asked to summarize an MR or issue or asked to provide more information then please post back a note to the MR/Issue so that the user can see it.
        You don't need to commit or push up changes, those will be done automatically based on the file changes you make.
